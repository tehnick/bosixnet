Project consist of two parts:
1) bosixnet-webui -- FastCGI program which passively listens for incoming
   connections and generates list of hosts in your IPv6 network. This daemon
   prepares data which may be put directly into /etc/hosts.
2) bosixnet-daemon -- shell script which periodically sends information about
   current IPv6 address to remote server and updates local /etc/hosts based on
   data received from that remote server. It is expected that bosixnet-webui
   is launched on that remote server.

For building own IPv6 network you need to install miredo, gogoc or any other
tunnel broker software on all hosts where bosixnet-daemon will be launched.
Of course you do not need any of these programs if your Internet provider
gives you direct access to IPv6 network. Unfortunately this is too rare
situation now.

There are few possible solutions for remote server with bosixnet-webui:
1) Fixed IPv4 or IPv6 address. But if you have statical IP you may use other
   solutions (like VPN) and this project is not very useful in your case.
2) Fixed domain name + dynamic IPv4. For example, using any DDNS provider.
3) Fixed domain name + dynamic IPv6. Some tunnel brokers give special domain
   names for their clients. For example, if you are registered on Freenet6 and
   use gogoc, you will have domain name like: tehnick.broker.freenet6.net
4) etc.

bosixnet-webui is a small program with very few dependencies. It may be easily
launched on embedded devices.

Important notes:
1) The speed of access via miredo is much better than via any tunnel brokers.
2) If two computers are in the same LAN, direct connection via miredo is not
   possible between them. So at least one of them should use tunnel broker.

Example of configuring nginx:
Edit file /etc/nginx/sites-available/default and paste something like this:
    location /bosixnet/ {
        fastcgi_pass   localhost:33169;
        include        /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    }
