*** bosixnet-daemon ***
* Fix update_hosts script after changing of behaviuor of `pidof` command line
  tool.
*** bosixnet-webui ***
* Fix cross-compilation for MS Windows using MinGW and MXE (https://mxe.cc/).
  This is just for fun. MS Windows is still not supported in this project.

--- 1.9 2017-02-08 ---
*** common ***
* Disable WITH_SYSVINIT_SUPPORT configuration option by default.
*** bosixnet-daemon ***
* Add "-L" option to `curl` command line tool in update_address and
  update_hosts scripts for simplifying migration from HTTP to HTTPS and/or
  between servers.
*** bosixnet-webui ***
* Tiny improvement in a counter of visits.

--- 1.8 2016-10-22 ---
*** common ***
* Add basic systemd support.
* Add WITH_SYSVINIT_SUPPORT, WITH_SYSTEMD_SUPPORT, SYSVINIT_SCRIPTS_DIR and
  SYSTEMD_UNIT_FILES_DIR cmake configuration options.
*** bosixnet-daemon ***
* Provide unique default value of HOST_NAME variable. But manual setup is more
  preferable in any case.
*** bosixnet-webui ***
* Update launcher script.
* Update hosts map only when host address is really changed.
* Rename BASIC_STR variable to PREFIX_STR.
* Add check that PREFIX_STR is always terminated by '/' character.
* Add special page "/timestamps": it shows list of hosts and timestamps of
  their last activity.
* Use show_map() instead of show_file() for "/hosts" and "/timestamps" pages.
  This allows to decrease the number of disk I/O operations and works faster
  (even with comparing with reading from modern SSD drive connected via SATA 3).
  [TODO: add link to tests results]
* Code refactoring.

--- 1.7 2015-09-30 ---
*** common ***
* Relicense from GPLv2 or later to Expat.
*** bosixnet-daemon ***
* Use `ip` tool instead of `ifconfig` for getting local IPv6 address.
* Added ability to select specific network device for getting local IPv6
  address. By default script searches IPv6 addresses for all network devices
  of the system and chooses the last of them.
* Protect file with list of hosts from simultaneous editing.
* Additional check if current IPv6 address is valid.

--- 1.6 2014-02-11 ---
*** bosixnet-daemon ***
* Improved simple check for validity of IPv6 addresses received from server:
  - strings should be longer than 6 characters
  - strings should have at least three ":" characters
  - fifth character from strings should be equal to ":"
  (Affects only script update_hosts.)
* Added support of multiple servers:
  - IPv6 address is sent to all available servers
  - data about hosts is got from the first server which replies to request
  See file bosixnet-daemon.conf for examples of configuring.
*** bosixnet-webui ***
* Removed support of POST requests.
* Added simple check for valid IPv6 address received in GET request:
  - string should be longer than 7 characters
  - string should be shorter than 40 characters
  - string should have at least three ":" characters
  - fifth character from string should be equal to ":"
  - string should contain only allowed characters (:0123456789abcdefABCDEF)
  The same check is used during loading the list of hosts from file.

--- 1.5 2014-02-05 ---
* Changed default user in webui_launcher from "user" to "bosixnet".
* Added man pages, updated README and fixed few typos in help.
* Renamed BASIC_URL variable to BASIC_STR.

--- 1.4 2014-02-04 ---
* Improved update_hosts: only strings with IPv6 addresses is copied into
  /etc/hosts, all rest data is ignored now.
* Small code refactoring in scripts: bosixnet_daemon, update_address,
  update_hosts, webui_launcher.

--- 1.3 2014-02-04 ---
* Small fix in bosixnet_daemon: send some useless warnings to /dev/null.
* Tiny fix in LOG_DIR variable.

--- 1.2 2014-02-04 ---
* Rewritten init scripts.
* Added script daemon_launcher.
* Updated script webui_launcher.

--- 1.1 2014-02-04 ---
* Update init scripts.

--- 1.0 2014-02-03 ---
* Changed version numbering scheme.
* Project was rewritten from qmake to cmake.
* Program bosixnet-webui was rewritten from QtCore 4.x to pure STL.
* Added support of config files into scripts: bosixnet_daemon, update_address,
  update_hosts and webui_launcher.
* Updated README.

--- 0.0.1 2013-10-17 ---
* Initial release.
